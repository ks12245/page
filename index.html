      <h2>Basic info</h2>
      <p>
      Sea pollution is a problem all around the world affecting not only animals but also people.There are 5.25 trillion pieces of plastic waste estimated to be in our oceans.At least 14 million tons of plastic end up in the ocean every year, and plastic makes up 80% of all marine debris found from surface waters to deep-sea sediments.By 2050 there will be more plastics in the oceans than fish.
